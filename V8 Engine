V8 compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code before executing it, instead of more traditional techniques such as interpreting 
bytecode or compiling the whole program to machine code and executing it from a filesystem.
The compiled code is additionally optimized (and re-optimized) dynamically at runtime,
based on heuristics of the code's execution profile.
