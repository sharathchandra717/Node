Space complexity is the amount of memory used by the algorithm (including the input values to the algorithm) to execute and 
produce the result.
Sometime Auxiliary Space is confused with Space Complexity. But Auxiliary Space is the extra space or the temporary space 
used by the algorithm during it's execution.

Space Complexity = Auxiliary Space + Input space

Time complexity of an algorithm signifies the total time required by the program to run till its completion.

Usually, the time required by an algorithm falls under three types −

Best Case − Minimum time required for program execution.

Average Case − Average time required for program execution.

Worst Case − Maximum time required for program execution.

Asymptotic notations are used to calculate the running time complexity of an algorithm.

Ο Notation
Ω Notation
θ Notation

Big Oh Notation, Ο
It measures the worst case time complexity or the longest amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete.

Omega Notation, Ω
It measures the best case time complexity or the best amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete.

Theta Notation, θ
It measures the average case time complexity or the average amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete.
