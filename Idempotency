In programming, idempotence can be a property of many different code elements, including functions, methods, requests 
and statements. Idempotence is a language-agnostic property: It means the same thing in any programming context.
An idempotent HTTP method is a HTTP method that can be called many times without different outcomes. It would not matter 
if the method is called only once, or ten times over. The result should be the same.

  a = 4;
  a++;
  
The first example is idempotent: no matter how many times we execute this statement, a will always be 4. The second 
example is not idempotent. Executing this 10 times will result in a different outcome.
