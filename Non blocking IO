Here the IO operations are performed independent of other system operations. Your system wonâ€™t let you to go into wait state, 
rather it can perform other operations which are independent of required IO. Response from IO devices are furnished to the 
system once the operation completes, however system wouldn't stall in that time. Once you get the response, it can trigger 
some function to be completed. Any new requests sent to the same IO device will be queued and responses are also returned 
one after other.
