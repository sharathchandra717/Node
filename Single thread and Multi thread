Multithreaded Programming

1. In this type of programming multiple threads run at the same time.

2. Multi threaded model doesnâ€™t use event loop with polling.

3. CPU time is never wasted.

4.Idle time is minimum.

5. It results in more efficient programs.

6. When one thread is paused due to some reason, other threads run as normal.

Single Threaded Programming

1. In this type of programming a single thread runs at a time.

2. Single threaded model uses a process event loop with polling.

3. CPU time is wasted.

4. Idle time is more.

5. It results in less efficient programs.

6. When one thread is paused, the system waits until this thread is resumed.
