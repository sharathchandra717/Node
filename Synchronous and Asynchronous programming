The difference is that in the first example, the program will block in the first line. The next line (console.log) will have to wait.

In the second example, the console.log will be executed WHILE the query is being processed. That is, the query will be processed 
in the background, while your program is doing other things, and once the query data is ready, you will do whatever you want with it.

So, in a nutshell: The first example will block, while the second won't.

The output of the following two examples:

// Example 1 - Synchronous (blocks)
var result = database.query("SELECT * FROM hugetable");
console.log("Query finished");
console.log("Next line");


// Example 2 - Asynchronous (doesn't block) 
database.query("SELECT * FROM hugetable", function(result) {
    console.log("Query finished");
});
console.log("Next line");

Would be:

1.  Query finished
    Next line

2.  Next line
    Query finished
