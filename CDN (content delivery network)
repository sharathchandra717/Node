A CDN (content delivery network), also called a content distribution network, is a group of geographically distributed and 
interconnected servers that provide cached internet content from a network location closest to a user to accelerate its 
delivery. The primary goal of a CDN is to improve web performance by reducing the time needed to transmit content and 
rich media to users' internet-connected devices.
Content delivery network architecture is also designed to reduce network latency, which is often caused by traffic over 
long distances and across multiple networks. Eliminating latency has become increasingly important, as more dynamic 
content, video and software as a service are delivered to a growing number of mobile devices.
